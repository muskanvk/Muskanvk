## नमस्ते, I'm Muskan  👩🏼‍💻
<img src= "https://github.com/muskanvk/Muskanvk/blob/master/intro2.png.png">
I'm a computer engineer who always strives to work on end to end products that produce a significant impact. Elon Musk once said, "The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur." As a  Computer Science Engineer, I live by this motto and delve into the nuances of what Computer Science has in store for all of us. I enjoy teaching ML, solving problems and working on new technologies. I am an avid speaker and have spoken at various colleges and meetups. Technology intruiges me because it has the power to touch people's life. So it ensures that there's something for everyone.
